#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is a branch in the field of Computer Science that deals with the designing, development, testing and maintenance of software programmes.
It is important in the creation of software applications that are:
Scalable - It lets companies build bigger, more complex software and adapt as user needs change and demand increases
Reliable - Software engineering practices such as testing, version control, and code reviews help create stable products that users can depend on.
Efficient - Properly engineered software makes better use of computing resources and developer time, reducing later costs and environmental impact.
Collaborative - Software allows tech teams to work together, especially on complex projects in a more efficient manner.
Secure - This helps identify and mitigate vulnerabilities beforehand due to testing and maintenance put in place.
Innovative - Software engineering creates platforms upon which new technologies can be built due to established solid foundations and frameworks.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Machine Learning and AI Integration - Since the 2010s, integration of machine learning and AI capabilities into mainstream software development has created new engineering challenges and opportunities. 
Cloud Computing - Since the early 2000s, Cloud platforms like Google Cloud transformed software from on-premises infrastructure to cloud services, changing architectural patterns and development practices.
DevOps Movement - From the early 2000s-2010s, DevOps bridged the gap between development and operations teams, emphasizing collaboration, automation, and continuous delivery. This approach accelerated software delivery cycles from months or years to days or even hours.
The Internet Revolution - The 1990s brought the World Wide Web which changed software engineering, shifting focus toward distributed systems, client-server architecture, and web applications. This created new challenges in security, scalability, and user interface design.
Rise of Software Development Tools - The development of specialized tools in the 1970s-1980s improved programmer productivity. This included the first Integrated Development Environments (IDEs), version control systems, debuggers, and compilers. Tools such as Unix (1969) and its programming environment gave developers powerful ways to create and manage code.
Structured Programming (1970s)
Before structured programming, "spaghetti code", often written with excessive "goto" statements creating that was difficult to follow. Pioneers like Edsger Dijkstra advocated for structured programming techniques using control structures (if-then-else, loops, subroutines) instead. This made code more readable, maintainable, and less error-prone.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Brief/ Information collection - This involves meeting with stakeholders, conduction interviews and creating specific requirements that outline the functionality, performance, and constraints of the system (what the software needs to do).

Analysis - This involves evaluation of the requirements listed above for feasibility, consistency, and completeness. This phase involves creating models of the system, identifying potential risks, and determining resources needed for development.

Design - The blueprint for the software solution is created in this phase. This includes architectural design (overall system structure), detailed design (modules and components), interface design (how users interact with the system), and database design (data organization and storage).

Implementation - Coding / writing the actual program. Developers use programming languages and development tools to create the software components according to coding standards and best practices.

Testing - The software is tested to evaluate if it works correctly and meets requirements. This includes unit testing (individual components), integration testing (combined components), system testing (complete application), and acceptance testing (user verification).

Deployment - The software is released to users. This includes installation, configuration, data migration, and training users on the new system.

Maintenance and Support - After deployment, the software is maintained to ensure it is functioning correctly.
This includes:
Corrective maintenance: Fixing bugs and issues
Adaptive maintenance: Modifying software to work in changing environments
Perfective maintenance: Improving performance or usability
Preventive maintenance: Updating systems to prevent future problems

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
The Waterfall methodology is a linear, sequential approach to software development where each phase must be completed before moving to the next one. It's called "waterfall" because progress flows steadily downward through distinct phases, like water flowing over steps.
Agile methodology is an iterative approach to software development that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and delivering working software quickly. Rather than planning the entire project upfront, Agile breaks development into short cycles called "sprints" (typically 1-4 weeks long).

Appropriate Use Cases
When to Use Waterfall

Regulatory Compliance Projects: When extensive documentation is required for compliance.
Fixed-Scope Projects: When requirements are well-understood and unlikely to change.
Projects with Physical Deliverables: When software development is tied to hardware development or physical systems.
Contract-Based Projects: When the scope, cost, and timeline must be precisely defined upfront.
Example: Developing control software for a nuclear power plant where safety requirements are strict and well-defined
         Government projects such as infrastructure upgrades
         Aviation systems for developing flight control software for an aircraft where requirements are rigid and thoroughly defined upfront.
        

When to Use Agile

Product Development with Evolving Requirements: When market conditions or user needs are likely to change.
Innovation-Focused Projects: When exploring new ideas or technologies where the solution isn't clearly defined.
Projects Requiring Frequent Stakeholder Feedback: When user experience is critical to success.
Startup Environments: When time-to-market is crucial and the initial product needs to be validated quickly.
Example: Developing a new mobile application where user feedback will shape feature priorities and design decisions.


Hybrid Approaches
Many organizations adopt hybrid methodologies that combine elements of both approaches.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developers are the builders who write the actual code that makes applications work. They need strong technical skills in programming languages, algorithms, and software architecture, combined with problem-solving abilities and attention to detail.
QA engineers ensure that software meets quality standards before it reaches users. They need strong analytical skills, attention to detail, and the ability to think from a user's perspective. They also need technical knowledge to understand how systems work and how to test them effectively.
Project managers coordinate the overall software development effort. They need strong leadership, communication, and organizational skills, along with knowledge of project management methodologies and tools.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs are software applications are important in code editing and syntax highlighting, dedugging, code completion and refactoring, integrated build and deployment and project management.
Examples are: Visual Studio, Xcode
VCS are systems that record changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. They are important for collaboration, change tracking, backup and restore, branching and merging, code reviews and collaboration.
Examples are: Git, Subversion (SVN)

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Managing Complexity
Meeting Deadlines
Technical Debt
 Collaboration and Communication - Poor communication and collaboration can lead to misunderstandings, duplicated work, and delays.
Identifying and fixing bugs can be time-consuming and frustrating. 



Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit: Unit testing focuses on testing individual functions in isolation.
Integration: Integration testing examines how components work together.
System: System testing evaluates the complete, integrated software system.
Acceptancce: Acceptance testing determines if the software meets business requirements and is ready for delivery to users.



#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
> Prompt engineering is the practice of crafting effective inputs or instructions for AI systems to elicit desired outputs. It involves strategically designing prompts that guide AI models toward generating accurate, relevant, and useful responses.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
> Summarize the three most significant impacts of climate change on coastal ecosystems in under 300 words. Include specific examples and cite recent research where relevant.
